# Controlling and granting database access

Authenticated users can be granted access using a number of different mechanisms. 

## Unrestricted administrative accounts
There are two possible administrative accounts with unrestricted permissions for access to the virtual master database and all user databases. These accounts are called server-level principal accounts.

### Azure SQL Database subscriber account
SQL Database creates a single login account in the master database when a logical SQL instance is created. This account is sometimes called the SQL Database Subscriber Account. This account connects using SQL Server authentication (user name and password). This account is an administrator on the logical server instance and on all user databases attached to that instance. The permissions of the Subscriber Account cannot be restricted. Only one of these accounts can exist.

### Azure Active Directory administrator
One Azure Active Directory individual or group account can also be configured as an administrator. It is optional to configure an Azure AD administrator, but an Azure AD administrator must be configured if you want to use Azure AD accounts to connect to SQL Database. For more information about configuring Azure Active Directory access, see [Connecting to SQL Database or SQL Data Warehouse By Using Azure Active Directory Authentication](sql-database-aad-authentication.md) and [SSMS support for Azure AD MFA with SQL Database and SQL Data Warehouse](sql-database-ssms-mfa-authentication.md).

### Configuring the firewall
When the server-level firewall is configured for an individual IP address or range, the Azure SQL Database Subscriber Account and the Azure Active Directory account can connect to the master database and all the user databases. The initial server-level firewall can be configured through the [Azure portal](sql-database-configure-firewall-settings.md), using [PowerShell](sql-database-configure-firewall-settings-powershell.md) or using the [REST API](sql-database-configure-firewall-settings-rest.md). Once a connection is made, additional server-level firewall rules can also be configured by using [Transact-SQL](sql-database-configure-firewall-settings-tsql.md).

### Administrator access path
When the server-level firewall is properly configured, the SQL Database Subscriber Account and the Azure Active Directory SQL Server Administrators can connect using client tools such as SQL Server Management Studio or SQL Server Data Tools. Only the latest tools provide all the features and capabilities. The following diagram shows a typical configuration for the two administrator accounts.

When using an open port in the server-level firewall, administrators can connect to any SQL Database.

### Connecting to a database by using SQL Server Management Studio
For a walk-through of creating a server, a database, server-level firewall rules, and using SQL Server Management Studio to query a database, see [Get started with Azure SQL Database servers, databases, and firewall rules by using the Azure portal and SQL Server Management Studio](sql-database-get-started.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is recommended that you always use the latest version of Management Studio to remain synchronized with updates to Microsoft Azure and SQL Database. [Update SQL Server Management Studio](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt238290.aspx).
>

## Additional server-level administrative roles
In addition to the server-level administrative roles discussed previously, SQL Database provides two restricted administrative roles in the virtual master database to which user accounts can be added that grant permissions to either crate databases or manage logins.

### Database creators
One of these administrative roles is the dbmanager role. Members of this role can create new databases. To use this role, you create a user in the master database and then add the user to the **dbmanager** database role. The user can be a contained database user, or a user based on a SQL Server login in the virtual master database.

1. Using an administrator account, connect to the virtual master database.
2. Optional step: Create a SQL Server authentication login, using the [CREATE LOGIN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms189751.aspx) statement. Sample statement:
   
   ```
   CREATE LOGIN Mary WITH PASSWORD = '<strong_password>';
   ```
   
   > [!NOTE]
   > Use a strong password when creating a login or contained database user. For more information, see [Strong Passwords](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms161962.aspx).
   > 
   > 
   
   To improve performance, logins (server-level principals) are temporarily cached at the database level. To refresh the authentication cache, see [DBCC FLUSHAUTHCACHE](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt627793.aspx).
3. In the virtual master database, create a user by using the [CREATE USER](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms173463.aspx) statement. The user can be an Azure Active Directory authentication contained database user (if you have configured your environment for Azure AD authentication), or a SQL Server authentication contained database user, or a SQL Server authentication user based on a SQL Server authentication login (created in the previous step.) Sample statements:
   
   ```
   CREATE USER [mike@contoso.com] FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER;
   CREATE USER Tran WITH PASSWORD = '<strong_password>';
   CREATE USER Mary FROM LOGIN Mary; 
   ```
4. Add the new user, to the **dbmanager** database role by using the [ALTER ROLE](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms189775.aspx) statement. Sample statements:
   
   ```
   ALTER ROLE dbmanager ADD MEMBER Mary; 
   ALTER ROLE dbmanager ADD MEMBER [mike@contoso.com];
   ```
   
   > [!NOTE]
   > The dbmanager is a database role in virtual master database so you can only add a user to the dbmanager role. You cannot add a server-level login to database-level role.
   > 
   > 
5. If necessary, configure the server-level firewall to allow the new user to connect.

Now the user can connect to the virtual master database and can create new databases. The account creating the database becomes the owner of the database.

### Login managers
The other administrative role is the login manager role. Members of this role can create new logins in the master database. If you wish, you can complete the same steps (create a login and user, and add a user to the **loginmanager** role) to enable a user to create new logins in the virtual master. Usually this is not necessary as Microsoft recommends using contained database users, which authenticate at the database-level instead of using users based on logins. For more information, see [Contained Database Users - Making Your Database Portable](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff929188.aspx).

## Non-administrator users
Generally, non-administrator accounts do not need access to the virtual master database. Create contained database users at the database level using the [CREATE USER (Transact-SQL)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms173463.aspx) statement. The user can be an Azure Active Directory authentication contained database user (if you have configured your environment for Azure AD authentication), or a SQL Server authentication contained database user, or a SQL Server authentication user based on a SQL Server authentication login (created in the previous step.) For more information, see [Contained Database Users - Making Your Database Portable](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff929188.aspx). 

To create users, connect to the database, and execute statements similar to the following examples:

```
CREATE USER Mary FROM LOGIN Mary; 
CREATE USER [mike@contoso.com] FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER;
```

Initially, only one of the administrators or the owner of the database can create users. To authorize additional users to create new users, grant that selected user the `ALTER ANY USER` permission, by using a statement such as:

```
GRANT ALTER ANY USER TO Mary;
```

To give additional users full control of the database, make them a member of the **db_owner** fixed database role using the `ALTER ROLE` statement.

> [!NOTE]
> The principal reason to create database users based on logins, is when you have SQL Server authentication users that need access to multiple databases. Users based on logins are tied to the login, and only one password that is maintained for that login. Contained database users in individual databases are each individual entities and each maintains its own password. This can confuse contained database users if they do not maintain their passwords as identical.
>

### Configuring the database-level firewall
As a best practice, non-administrator users should only have access through the firewall to the databases that they use. Instead of authorizing their IP addresses through the server-level firewall and giving them access to all databases, use the [sp_set_database_firewall_rule](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn270010.aspx) statement to configure the database-level firewall. The database-level firewall cannot be configured by using the portal.

### Non-administrator access path
When the database-level firewall is properly configured, the database users can connect using client tools such as SQL Server Management Studio or SQL Server Data Tools. Only the latest tools provide all the features and capabilities. The following diagram shows a typical non-administrator access path.

![Non-administrator access path](./media/sql-database-manage-logins/2sql-db-nonadmin-access.png)

## Groups and roles
Efficient access management uses permissions assigned to groups and roles instead of individual users. 

- When using Azure Active Directory authentication, put Azure Active Directory users into an Azure Active Directory group. Create a contained database user for the group. Place one or more database users into a [database role](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms189121) and then assign [permissions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms191291.aspx) to the database role.

- When using SQL Server authentication, create contained database users in the database. Place one or more database users into a [database role](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms189121) and then assign [permissions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms191291.aspx) to the database role.

The database roles can be the built-in roles such as **db_owner**, **db_ddladmin**, **db_datawriter**, **db_datareader**, **db_denydatawriter**, and **db_denydatareader**. **db_owner** is commonly used to grant full permission to only a few users. The other fixed database roles are useful for getting a simple database in development quickly, but are not recommended for most production databases. For example, the **db_datareader** fixed database role grants read access to every table in the database, which is usually more than is strictly necessary. It is far better to use the [CREATE ROLE](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms187936.aspx) statement to create your own user-defined database roles and carefully grant each role the least permissions necessary for the business need. When a user is a member of multiple roles, they aggregate the permissions of them all.

## Permissions
There are over 100 permissions that can be individually granted or denied in SQL Database. Many of these permissions are nested. For example, the `UPDATE` permission on a schema includes the `UPDATE` permission on each table within that schema. As in most permission systems, the denial of a permission overrides a grant. Because of the nested nature and the number of permissions, it can take careful study to design an appropriate permission system to properly protect your database. Start with the list of permissions at [Permissions (Database Engine)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms191291.aspx) and review the [poster size graphic](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=229142) of the permissions.


### Considerations and restrictions
When managing logins and users in SQL Database, consider the following:

* You must be connected to the **master** database when executing the ``CREATE/ALTER/DROP DATABASE`` statements. - The database user in the master database corresponding to the server-level principal login cannot be altered or dropped. 
* US-English is the default language of the server-level principal login.
* Only the administrators (server-level principal login or Azure AD administrator) and the members of the **dbmanager** database role in the **master** database have permission to execute the ``CREATE DATABASE`` and ``DROP DATABASE`` statements.
* You must be connected to the master database when executing the ``CREATE/ALTER/DROP LOGIN`` statements. However using logins is discouraged. Use contained database users instead.
* To connect to a user database, you must provide the name of the database in the connection string.
* Only the server-level principal login and the members of the **loginmanager** database role in the **master** database have permission to execute the ``CREATE LOGIN``, ``ALTER LOGIN``, and ``DROP LOGIN`` statements.
* When executing the ``CREATE/ALTER/DROP LOGIN`` and ``CREATE/ALTER/DROP DATABASE`` statements in an ADO.NET application, using parameterized commands is not allowed. For more information, see [Commands and Parameters](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms254953.aspx).
* When executing the ``CREATE/ALTER/DROP DATABASE`` and ``CREATE/ALTER/DROP LOGIN`` statements, each of these statements must be the only statement in a Transact-SQL batch. Otherwise, an error occurs. For example, the following Transact-SQL checks whether the database exists. If it exists, a ``DROP DATABASE`` statement is called to remove the database. Because the ``DROP DATABASE`` statement is not the only statement in the batch, executing the following Transact-SQL statement results in an error.

```
IF EXISTS (SELECT [name]
           FROM   [sys].[databases]
           WHERE  [name] = N'database_name')
     DROP DATABASE [database_name];
GO
```

* When executing the ``CREATE USER`` statement with the ``FOR/FROM LOGIN`` option, it must be the only statement in a Transact-SQL batch.
* When executing the ``ALTER USER`` statement with the ``WITH LOGIN`` option, it must be the only statement in a Transact-SQL batch.
* To ``CREATE/ALTER/DROP`` a user requires the ``ALTER ANY USER`` permission on the database.
* When the owner of a database role tries to add or remove another database user to or from that database role, the following error may occur: **User or role 'Name' does not exist in this database.** This error occurs because the user is not visible to the owner. To resolve this issue, grant the role owner the ``VIEW DEFINITION`` permission on the user.
